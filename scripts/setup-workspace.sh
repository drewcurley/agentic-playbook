#!/usr/bin/env sh
# setup-workspace.sh — wire up a multi-repo project to this shared playbook.
#
# WHAT IT DOES (idempotent — safe to re-run):
#   1. Confirms this playbook sits in a workspace root alongside the project repos.
#   2. For each repo listed in ../<repo> that exists as a sibling, installs the
#      playbook's git hooks into it (copies .githooks/ and sets core.hooksPath),
#      so the procedure in AGENTS.md is enforced in EVERY repo of the project.
#   3. Reports which repos from workspace.manifest.md are present / missing.
#
# WHY copy hooks instead of share them: git's core.hooksPath is per-repo and
# cannot point outside a repo's own tree in a portable way. Copying keeps each
# repo self-contained and lets CI mirror the same hooks server-side.
#
# Run from the playbook repo root:  sh scripts/setup-workspace.sh
# Re-run after adding a repo to workspace.manifest.md.

Done. Each present repo now enforces the AGENTS.md procedure locally.
Reminder: hooks are per-repo. CI must also run the mirror (.github/workflows/checks.yml)
in EACH repo so --no-verify can't bypass the gates server-side.

Next:
  - Fill in docs/integration-map.md with the cross-repo seams.
  - Each repo runs its own docs bootstrap (AGENTS.md § 6) before feature work.
  - Aggregate every repo's /docs into the playbook (golden source of truth):
      sh scripts/aggregate-docs.sh      then commit docs/repos/   (AGENTS.md § 6.6)
